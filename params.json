  "body": "### What is it?\r\nIt's a set of matlab functions [with a simple gui] for plotting source localised SPM12 MEEG data at group level, identifying peaks and extracting relevant timeseries.\r\n\r\n### What does it do?\r\nIt loads up a template mesh and plots the group 'averaged' overlay for a given trial on top. From this, you can click an area of interest to find the coordinates of this 'peak'. There's a function that then finds each individual subjects' nearest source to that point [within a given radius]. You can then either reconstruct the data [time by trials] for the given identified vertices and store in a matrix, or call an spm built in function which extracts those vertices into a new LFP-SPM object for each individual dataset.\r\n\r\n### Why'd you make it?\r\nBecause I recently came to SPM from other softwares and I wanted to keep the same analysis approach that I'd used previously. \r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\nFor the gui: VSExtractor_gui\r\n\r\nFor a script: Click_to_extract_virtual_sensors\r\n\r\n",
